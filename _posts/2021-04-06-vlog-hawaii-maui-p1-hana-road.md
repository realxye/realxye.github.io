Hawaii might be the most beautiful place I have ever been.
This is first day of my family trip to Maui, Hawaii.
We took flight in early morning to Maui, then drove to Hana and stayed there for one night.
The blue ocean, waterfalls, rain forest and the amazing black pebble beach. Everything is so beautiful.
