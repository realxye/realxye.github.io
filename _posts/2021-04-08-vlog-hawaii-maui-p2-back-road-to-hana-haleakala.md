Got up early for the sunrise. And then headed towards Haleakalā along the Back Road to Hana.
The road is much more dangerous than the road to Hana, but it also has amazing views.
Haleakalā is high (more than 10000 feet). The visitor center is halfway up the mountain and is hidden in the clouds.
Drove through the clouds and we see the sea of the clouds under our feet.
