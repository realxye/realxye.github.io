Finally, got my github pages done.

It was confused for me about how to apply Jekyll Themes. At begining, I followed tutorial to download & install Ruby/Jekyll and other stuff and then I realized that I don't need to start from scratch. After all, I just want to have a blog on github. Here are simple steps:

### **Step 1:** Find a theme

Themes can be found in many places like [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/), [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/) and others. Or just simply [search in Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=jekyll+themes).

Consider following things when you choose a theme:

- Do you like it?
- Does it support mobile view?
- Do you need side column for categories, posts list, etc?
- Do you need features like search, analytics, etc?
- Do you need to support comments?

### **Step 2:** Apply the theme

Most of themes are on github.com. So just simply go to its repo (I use **[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie)**).

#### *First option: create from the template*

For example,
- Press the **`"Use this template"`** button
![Use Template](/images/20191025-get-started/github-use-template.png)

- Fill new repo's information and press **`"Create repository from template"`** button
![Use Template](/images/20191025-get-started/github-create-repo-from-template.png)

#### *Second option: download files and update your repo directly*

If you have already created your repo, you can download template and put all files into your repo directly. (This is what I did)

### **Step 3:** Customize

After step #2 you should be able to see your pages (same as the template). Next is to customize pages to make it your own.

- Go over the pages quickly and find out all the text, pictures and links belong to the template. (For example, `title`, `description`, `names`, `icon`, etc).
- Update text, use your own.
- Update links to you home page, twitter, github, linkedin, etc.
- Create/Choose your own picture used by your pages.
- Modify template source code when it is necessary (I have to say that no template can meet expectation perfectly --  a little bit change can make it much better).

**Don't spend too much time on this, theme is never the purpose**

### **Step 4:** Post

That's the most important part! Write first post and post it!

### **Tricks**

- Edit your post under `_drafts` folder, when it is done, move it to `_posts` folder and prefix its file name with `"YYYY-MM-DD-"`.
- Create a folder for each post under `images`(or `img`) using the post's name, and put all images used by this post into that folder.
