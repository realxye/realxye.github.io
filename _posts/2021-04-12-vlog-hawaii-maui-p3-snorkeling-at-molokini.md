Snorkeling at Molokini is probably one of the most anticipated projects on Maui. We made a reservation two months ago before this trip.

On the third day we drove to the pier at 5:30 in the morning, where we took a boat to Molokini.

Molokini is a crescent-shaped, partially submerged volcanic crater that hangs like a crescent moon on the sea between Maui and Kaho ªolawe islands. The sea in the crater is relatively calm, from shallow to deep, which is very suitable for snorkeling and scuba.

The underwater world there is beautiful. It's a pity that I tried to shoot underwater with GoPro for the first time, and I didn't make too many usable footages.
